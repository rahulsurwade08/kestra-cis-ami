# Kestra-CIS-Hardening

This project involves integrating Kestra, an open-source data orchestration platform, with Terraform to implement a GitOps-based workflow for infrastructure management. The goal is to automate the deployment and lifecycle of infrastructure using Git as the single source of truth and integrating security like CIS hardening to an AMI while leveraging Kestra's workflow capabilities to manage the entire CI/CD pipeline.
